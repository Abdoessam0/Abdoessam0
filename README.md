## About Me

From a young age, I’ve been fascinated by how technology shapes our world. This curiosity led me to pursue **Computer Engineering at Atatürk University**, where I’m honing my skills and expanding my knowledge every day.

Over the years, I’ve grown into a passionate **Full-Stack Developer** with a focus on creating scalable and efficient web applications using **React** and **Node.js**. Along the way, I discovered my love for problem-solving and crafting seamless user experiences.

I’ve also gained valuable experience working as a **WordPress developer**, building responsive websites, and providing technical support that bridges the gap between technology and users. These experiences strengthened my ability to adapt, communicate, and deliver under real-world conditions.

Currently, I am diving deeper into **system engineering and DevOps**, eager to master the tools and methodologies that power modern software development.

I’m actively seeking exciting **work, training, or internship opportunities** where I can apply my skills, continue learning, and contribute meaningfully to innovative projects.
